# Smart Indoor Irrigation System

## Introduction

The "Smart Indoor Irrigation System" project is designed to automate the watering process for indoor plants, promoting optimal growth while conserving water. By integrating a soil moisture sensor with a relay-controlled water pump, this system intelligently manages water supply based on the moisture level of the soil. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, the system reads the soil moisture data and controls the pump accordingly, ensuring that plants receive adequate hydration without overwatering. This approach not only enhances plant health but also provides an efficient, user-friendly solution for indoor gardening.

## Features

- **Automated Watering**: Automatically waters plants when soil moisture is low.
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Continuously monitors soil moisture levels.
- **Efficient Water Use**: Helps in conserving water by only watering when necessary.
- **Easy to Set Up**: Simple wiring and code make it easy to set up and operate.
